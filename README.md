This is a simple project that I made to help me and my co-workers. I work at the courthouse and at certain cases the Judge determines that we freeze the value of the debt of the debtor’s account, if the freezed value is less than 15% of the debt we need do unfreeze it, if it is greater or equal to 15% the process continue. 

## Technologies:
React.JS <br />
TypeScript <br />
Material UI <br />


## A little more on the project

I used React.JS to develop this app because it’s what I’m currently learning and wanted to practice using `props` and making dynamic templates. I also used a mask on the input value, something that I had never done it before, so it show the number on the Brazilian format, instead of 1’000.32 it’s 1.000,32.
